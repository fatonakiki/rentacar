    <p>Rentalcars.com is a trading name of Booking.com Transport Limited, which is a limited company registered in England and Wales (Number: 05179829), whose registered address is at 100 New Bridge Street, London, EC4V 6JA. These terms & conditions, together with our privacy notice and cookie statement, constitute our agreement with you, for the services we provide in arranging for the supply of car hire. For the avoidance of doubt, 'you' refers to the main driver, the person paying for the rental and/or the person making the booking. Please note, although 'you' may refer to more than one person, we contract with all parties, but we will only be able to speak to the main driver in respect of a confirmed booking. Together, these are referred to as 'our terms'. These terms shall apply to all contracts for the provision of our services to the exclusion of all other terms & conditions. No conduct by Rentalcars.com shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of any other terms. Acceptance of the services or signature on any agreement shall be deemed conclusive evidence of your acceptance of these terms. We may change the terms from time to time and you are advised to check the website to consider any changes to the terms which apply to you. Your hire of any car is subject to the terms & conditions of car hire imposed by the car hire company and to the corresponding laws of the country and/or state in which the rental takes place. Individual restrictions may also apply to your car hire.</p>
    <p>You will be provided with a car by us either directly or as agent. The capacity in which we act depends on our relationship with the car hire company.</p>
    <p>These terms apply to any booking that you make with us on or through this website, so you should make sure that you are aware of their contents. Both our terms and those of the car hire companies we work with contain some exclusions and limitations of liability.</p>
    <p>Your booking on this website is conditional on you accepting our terms. If you do not agree with any part of them, you must not proceed with your booking. By confirming that you wish to book a car through this website you indicate that you have read and understood and accept our terms. If there is any part that you do not fully understand, or if you have a query about the car hire or any other product, please Contact us.</p>

    <h2 class="h2 section-title">Confirming your booking and taking payment</h2>
        <p>In most cases, we will confirm your booking immediately using the email address provided when the booking is made. Sometimes, we need to wait for the car hire company to confirm that a car is available. We will tell you straight away if this happens, and temporarily block the money on your payment card. As soon as they confirm your car, we will let you know, and take the money from your card.</p>
    <p>Until your car is confirmed, you can 'void' the payment at any time. Just hit 'Manage booking' at the top of our site, enter the email address provided when making the booking and reservation number, then hit 'Cancel Booking'. We will unblock the money on your card.</p>
    <p>Very rarely, a car hire company can't confirm that a car is available. If this happens, we will tell you, and unblock the money on your card.</p>
    <p>When you book a car or other product on our site, we will email you to confirm its availability within 48 hours of booking (or, if earlier, at least 24 hours before your pick-up time). We will then send you a booking confirmation.</p>
